\begin{abstract}
Many visions and ideas arise from increasing computational and communicational capabilities of recent and future automotive vehicles.
Early studies have to show the feasability and potential of these ideas to foster future research and development.

\section{Motivation}

State of the art: eco-routing (energy efficient, fast) + Urban traffic control (cooperative)

Problem: Cooperative eco-routing approaches

Contribution: Cooperative eco-routing demonstration based on behavior estimation framework.
In the following we describe shortly the underlying framework before explaining the cooperative vehicle routing demonstrator.

Estimation algorithm

\section{Cooperative Eco-Routing}

Model architecture: Context (i.e.\ vehicle) component, constraint component, objective component, control component, equivalence component.

Component behavior: Speed selection, edge selection, edge-based collision detection, energy consumption, etc.

Behavior estimation: One basic case (single vehicle, two routes) and one more complex case (multiple vehicles).

\section{Conclusion and Outlook}

Great stuff! :)
