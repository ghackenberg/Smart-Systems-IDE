Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have come a long way targeting recent problems of increasing emissions and growing vehicle numbers. Current approaches address a variety of objectives including congestion management, collision avoidance, energy-efficiency and emission reduction. However, respective solutions typically are designed for and tailored to a set of predefined objectives. Consequently, the effects of changing objectives and priorities cannot be assessed easily. To address this situation we present a lightweight approach to estimating traffic behavior early in systems engineering using non-deterministic models and stochastic optimization techniques. We demonstrate the feasibility of the framework using a basic traffic scenario and conclude with an outlook on future research activities.

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

In recent decades, efforts to engineer ITS have come a long way targeting contemporary and future problems of increasing emissions and growing vehicle numbers. Among the approaches two main directions can be distinguished: (1)~Urban Traffic Control (UTC) focusing on multiple traffic participants and their interaction e.g.~\cite{Chen2010,Dresner2008} and (2)~Eco-Routing focusing on a single traffic participant and his route e.g.~\cite{Ericsson2006,Boriboonsomsin2012}. Hereby, UTC typically targets congestion management and collision avoidance~\cite{Chen2010}. Technically, the approaches usually rely on agent-based techniques to describe human driving behavior with respect to traffic supervision and control~\cite{Chen2010}. More advanced approaches even consider fully autonomous vehicles, thereby proposing an alternative to human-oriented traffic supervision and control~\cite{Dresner2008}. In contrast, Eco-Routing typically targets energy-efficiency and emission reduction~\cite{Ericsson2006}. Technically, the approaches usually rely on optimization techniques to describe route variables, constraints and objectives~\cite{Ericsson2006}. As frequent use of energy-efficient routes might cause congestion, advanced approaches finally incorporate historical and real-time traffic information, thereby taking first steps towards bridging the gap between Eco-Routing and UTC~\cite{Boriboonsomsin2012}. Common among all previous approaches are objectives like congestion management, collision avoidance, energy-efficiency and emission reduction.

However, while the presented approaches offer tailored solutions for a set of predefined objectives, they are not designed to estimate the effect of changing objectives and priorities. In particular, it is important to estimate these effects in early phases of systems engineering (such as requirements discovery or feasibility study) to uncover potential opportunities and threats~\cite{Whitten2005}. To address this situation subsequently we present a dedicated lightweight model-based approach.

\section{A Lightweight Model-Based Approach}
\label{sec:approach}

An overview of our model-based approach is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:framework}.
Technically, we base our work on emergent property estimation techniques
described in~\cite{Hackenberg2012}. Consequently, we use a discrete-time and
hybrid-state system model. We rely on discrete-time models to reduce the
reachable state space during behavior estimation. However, we employ hybrid-state models as quantities like velocity or distance can be described more intuitively in continuous space, while for routing, road segments of the traffic infrastructure can be abstracted to discrete graph edges. Further, we employ a generic model architecture separating between context, constraint, objective, software and equivalence model connected through input and output channels. The \textit{non-deterministic} software model describes the possible control behavior (i.e.\ I/O spectrum), but not the actual control logic (i.e.\ I/O mapping), thereby reducing development effort. In contrast, the context model describes the controlled physical state. Based on the physical state the constraint and objective models define the operational limits and costs. Finally, the equivalence model describes how physical states can be clustered during optimization. For behavior estimation the framework integrates stochastic approximation techniques~\cite{Pereira1991} to achieve robustness against arbitrary models.

The approach is similar to work on vehicle path optimization~\cite{Danielsson2007}, which uses Modelica to specify dynamic optimization problems and Optimica for out-of-the-box optimization. However, the author uses continuous-time models instead and concentrates on a single vehicle only.

\section{Model Details and First Estimations}

In the following we describe the system model in more detail before demonstrating behavior estimation on a basic traffic scenario including time and energy objectives.

\subsubsection*{System Model}

As discussed before, in our model the traffic infrastructure is represented as
directed graph. Nodes constitute reference points in the environment such as
intersections and are defined by their absolute position (i.e.\ latitude,
longitude and elevation). Edges represent road segments and are defined by
source and target node as well as assigned number of lanes. Finally, for
demonstration we use a time resolution of 60 seconds, but other resolutions can
be configured as well, affecting computational effort and resolution of
physical state.

The \textit{context model} is composed of vehicle components, which define several inputs and outputs for each time step: Inputs are the speed and the target segment on the traffic infrastructure representing a routing decision in case a node is passed. Outputs are the input segment, the distance traveled on the segment, the energy consumption and the state of charge. The energy consumption is estimated from the traveled elevation profile and the speed. Based on the vehicle segments and traveled distances on the segments the \textit{constraint model} tests for collisions. Collisions occur in case the number of vehicles intersecting on the same segment exceeds the number of assigned lanes. Note that the constraint does not consider instantaneous driving behavior between time steps, which is omitted due to physical state space reduction. Then, the \textit{objective model} encodes two conflicting objectives: Energy-efficiency and shortest traveling time. Both system-level objectives are decomposed into equivalent vehicle objectives. Per vehicle energy costs are measured in terms of cumulative energy consumption while traveling from origin to destination. In contrast, time costs are measured in terms of time steps needed while traveling from origin to destination. At system-level, the independent vehicle objectives are aggregated using respective weights for energy-efficiency and shortest traveling time. To complete the control loop the \textit{software model} encodes \textit{non-deterministic} selection of speed and target segment per vehicle. The speed is selected from a continuous interval ranging from zero to a constant maximum. In contrast, the target segments are given by the set of outgoing segments of the current segment's target node. Finally, the \textit{equivalence model} uses the average state of charge over all vehicles for clustering the state space. This rule has been selected after testing several clustering strategies.

\subsubsection*{Behavior Estimation}

To demonstrate multi-objective behavior estimation, we configured a basic
traffic scenario including ten vehicles with same origin and destination. Between origin and destination two different single-laned routes are defined: The first represents a longer, but flat route, while the second describes a shorter, but undulating route. Finally, we analyze two different objective configurations modeled by means of weights: Configuration A favors lower energy cost, while configuration B prefers lower time cost.

Figure~\ref{figure:results} shows the results of behavior estimation including
selected routes (colored by vehicle) and aggregate energy consumption. In the route visualizations edge thickness represents the time steps needed to travel the respective road segments. In configuration A eight out of ten vehicles decide to take the upper flat route, while overall more time is needed to travel the segments. Instead, in configuration B eight out of ten vehicles decide to take the lower undulating route, while overall less time is needed to travel the segments. These observations are confirmed by the aggregate energy consumption chart: In configuration A the vehicles require 44\% less energy, but three times as long to travel from origin to destination compared to configuration B.

\section{Conclusion and Outlook}

The preliminary results are encouraging with respect to the feasibility of the model-based approach for multi-objective behavior estimation in the traffic systems domain. Currently, we are working on model and estimation improvement, a large-scale demonstrator, more diverse objectives and the inclusion of multi-modal traveling facilities such as bikes and trains.
