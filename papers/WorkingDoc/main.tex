	\section{Introduction}
	
	Guaranteeing sustainability and minimizing negative environmental impacts are crucial challenges for future power and transportation systems. Widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) as well as high penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) causes substantial changes within these systems. Here, within the power systems, intermittent power outputs require elaborate load balancing strategies while increasing adoption of autonomous electric vehicles requires addressing changing mobility demands in the transportation system. To comprehensively address constraints, objectives and design alternatives of both transportation and power systems, sustainable and integrated planning, operation and control strategies have to be established within integrated transportation and power systems.
	
	According planning, operation and control strategies are frequently  addressed within the concept of vehicle-to-grid (V2G). V2G describes a concept, where energy is released from EV batteries to the power system in times of increased power demand.  By facilitating interaction between power system and EVs, V2G possesses the potential to significantly reduce the amount of excess renewable energy produced within the power system \cite{richardson2013electric}. More generally, significant advantages as well as disadvantages can be argued for widespread V2G adoption. Here, both environmental and economic benefits have been shown in the past \cite{faria2012sustainability, richardson2013electric, mwasilu2014electric}. Furthermore, key benefits of V2G include reduction of emissions, increased efficiency as well as stability and reliability of the power system \cite{yilmaz2013review}.
	
	On the contrary, Mwasilu et al.~\cite{mwasilu2014electric} argue that for V2G adoption in a smart grid context central technological issues have to be addressed first such as coping with communication delays, establishing routing protocols and cyber security. Adding to that, the authors argue that frequent charging and discharging cycles causing rapid battery degradation for EV batteries as well as low penetration of electric vehicles with V2G functionality hinder more widespread V2G adoption.
	
	Nevertheless, previous work on plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) has shown their ability to contribute to balancing the fluctuation of intermittent renewable energy sources \cite{dallinger2012grid}. Currently, V2G represents a supplementary strategy to address situations in the power system with increased power demand. Currently, available intermittent renewable energy sources have to be supplemented with conventional energy sources as well as energy storages within the power system. To achieve a continuous balance between energy supply and demands within power systems, prevalent control schemes rely on automatic control schemes which are supervised by human operators. Here, according control schemes are subject to challenges from increasing levels of fluctuating RES \cite{heussen2012unified}.
	
	Given these current and future challenges and the prospected impact of RES and EVs on such systems, effective integrated control strategies to handle future power and mobility demands still have a long way to go and are subject to ongoing research.

	\section{Related work}
	\label{related_work}
	
	In the following we first review related approaches in Section~\ref{approaches} before deriving remaining problems in Section~\ref{problems}.
	
	\subsection{Approaches}
	\label{approaches}
		
	Previous studies have shown that, given a high penetration of EVs, uncontrolled charging can impose increased peak loads within the distribution network \cite{lopes2009identifying}. Intelligent scheduling methods are widely discussed as key approaches to integrate electric vehicles into the power grid \cite{yang2015computational}. According approaches often focus on minimizing single or multiple objectives within given power system models, while restricting valid behavior in terms of a set of constraints. For instance, typical objectives are minimizing cost (or maximizing welfare), power losses, emissions, power deviations or optimizing battery performance of EVs within power systems \cite{yang2015computational}. Here, the power systems are consisted of a number of electric devices such as conventional or renewable energy sources, energy consumers as well as electric infrastructure.
	
	In this context, Andreotti et al.~\cite{andreotti2012review} compare single-objective optimization methods within a smart grid context under the presence of EVs to evaluate model effectiveness in terms of operational limits and used objective functions. In this context, to sufficiently address technical and economic objectives for PEVs, the authors argue higher suitability of multi-objective optimization methods. 
	
	Zakariazadeh et al.~\cite{zakariazadeh2014multi} propose a multi-objective scheduling method for electric vehicles within a smart distribution network addressing economic and environmental objectives as well as technical constraints. Here, the approach manages to reduce operational costs and emissions, achieving Pareto-optimal solutions.
	
	To achieve optimal charging decisions for EVs, Ota et al.~\cite{ota2012autonomous} propose a decentralized V2G control scheme to address the intermittency of RES energy production using electric vehicles. However, the authors focus on the effects of an according charging control scheme within an isolated power system only.
	
	Here, approaches often restrict the impact of electric vehicles to decisions on charging or discharging their batteries at charging stations. However, in subsequence, individual EV objectives describing routing preferences such as shortest traveling time or energy-efficiency for EVs cannot be sufficiently taken into account. Instead, emphasis is put on the power system side, while the transportation system including traffic participants isn't represented microscopically. 
	
	Another highly relevant direction for efficiently integrating electric vehicles into the power grid and reduce negative impacts is are approaches utilizing Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). Methods for vehicle routing typically focus on optimizing route selection for single or multiple traffic participants towards single or multiple objectives and a given set of constraints. Addressing objectives of energy-efficiency in terms of routing problems, Eco-Routing approaches target energy-efficient route selection. In contrast, Eco-Driving approaches target energy-efficient intermediate driving behavior ~\cite{ericsson2006optimizing}.
	
	Felipe et al.~\cite{felipe2014heuristic} propose multiple heuristics for routing electric vehicles which consider different partial recharge strategies and recharge technologies while traveling along routes. However, approaches does not take the effects of recharging within the power system into account for general cost evaluation. 
	
	Integrating both scheduling and routing approaches for EV, Barco et al.~\cite{barco2013optimal} present an approach for minimizing operation cost for battery electric vehicle (BEV) fleets. While the authors propose a methodology which focuses on optimal routing and scheduling of charge for EV fleets, the approach does not consider effects on the power system when making routing and charging decisions in EVs.

	\subsection{Problems}
	\label{problems}
	
	In summary, we found that current approaches do not sufficiently address the objectives and constraints of both transportation and power systems to holistically estimate the effects of future power and transportation system scenarios. While approaches for scheduling EVs heavily address the effects of EVs within the power system, they neglect their effects on the transportation system. In contrast, routing approaches for EVs heavily address the effects of single or multiple EVs within the transportation system, in which routes are optimized, but neglect a detailed representation of the power system and it's underlying objectives.

	\section{Proposed work}
	\label{proposed_work}
	
	In the following we first describe the theoretical backgrounds of our work in Section~\ref{backgrounds} before summarizing the contributions of this article in Section~\ref{contributions}
	
	\subsection{Backgrounds}
	\label{backgrounds}
	
	In \cite{Hackenberg2012} we presented a model of the electric power system suitable for large-scale computation. The model divides the power system into regions and subregions. In each time step for each region the power balance is calculated as the sum of all subregion power balances.
	
	Then, in \cite{ascher2014early} we presented a model that captures the mobility demands of individual vehicles within transportation systems. For this, the technique employs a representation which formulates multi-objective traffic flows as optimal control problems. Furthermore, the transportation infrastructure is represented as directed graph, where the edges and the distances traveled on edges represent the positions of electric vehicles.
	
	Finally, in \cite{ascher2015integrated} we presented a component-based model which allows one to express static interaction (e.g. between vehicle and controller) as well as dynamic interaction between components (e.g. vehicle and charging station). Here, the presented modeling approach allows one to microscopically model power systems based on individual electric devices and transportation systems based on individual cars in terms of components. We then proposed a integrated transportation and power system model, which allows to capture the respective demands of both transportation and power systems.
	
	\subsection{Contributions}
	\label{contributions}
	
	In this work, we extend our previous work and present a more extensive and detailed formulation of our model for integrated transportation and power systems. 
	
	Within the transportation system mobility demands are expressed by passengers, who impose (1)~position preferences including origin and destination of travel as well as (2)~time preferences, which include departure and arrival times. Different modes of transportation (pedestrian, electric vehicle, public transportation) can be used by passengers to satisfy the mobility demands. 
	
	\todo{Multi-modal passenger transport.}
	
	Within the power system, power demands are expressed by electric devices in terms of electric power loads (or energy flows) within specific times and durations. For being able to satisfy power demands, the power system can employ different energy sources (renewable, conventional), which require resources (coal, gas) and cause emissions resulting from the employed resources.

	\section{Proposed model}
	\label{proposed_model}
	
	In the following we describe our model for integrated multi-objective optimal multi-modal passenger transport and energy flow control. Our model is illustrated in Figure~\ref{illustration}. The transportation system is modeled using a directed graph, where the nodes represent intersections and the edges represent transport segments. Furthermore, the edges are colored with respect to the mode of transport (e.g.\ pedestrian, EV, public transport). In contrast, the power system is modeled using a tree, where the nodes represent regions and the edges represent a containment relationship.

	\end{figure}
	
	Section~\ref{modalities} introduces are model of transport modalities. Section~\ref{transport} describes our model of the transport infrastructure. Section~\ref{passengers} explains our passenger model. Section~\ref{vehicles} highlights our vehicle model. Section~\ref{collisions} defines our collision criteria. Section~\ref{power} summarizes our model of the power infrastructure. Section~\ref{charging_stations} describes our model of charging stations. Section~\ref{power_batteries} explaing our model of power batteries. Section~\ref{solar_panels} defines our model of solar panels (i.e.\ power generators). Finally, Section~\ref{static_loads} summarizes our model of static loads (i.e.\ non-controllable loads).
