\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

Increasingly high penetration of both electric vehicles (EV) and renewable energy sources (RES) will prove a tough challenge for future power and transportation systems. In this paper, we presented an approach for establishing optimal control strategies for potentially challenging future scenarios. We presented formal formulations for our model in terms of the individual components of transportation and power systems. 
%We demonstrated the feasibility of our approach using a set of incremental scenarios. However, while our approach offers advantages with regard to it's comprehensive planning strategies, the validity of our approach has to be evaluated in the future. 
Future work includes establishing large-scale integrated planning strategies and assessing their applicability for multi-modal passenger transportation and logistics problems.
