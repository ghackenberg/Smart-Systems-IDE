\section{Discussion and outlook}
\label{conclusion}

Increasingly high penetration of both electric vehicles (EV) and renewable energy sources (RES) will prove a tough challenge for future power and transportation systems. To enable integrated system design, we presented the TRANSP-0 design abstraction for rapidly formulating and evaluating integrated transportion and power system design options. In this paper, we described the individual components of the design abstraction in terms of static design parameters, dynamic aspects of system design and the requirements optimal control strategies for designs have to satisfy.
%We demonstrated the feasibility of our approach using a set of incremental scenarios. However, while our approach offers advantages with regard to it's comprehensive planning strategies, the validity of our approach has to be evaluated in the future. 
Future work includes establishing large-scale integrated planning strategies and assessing their applicability for multi-modal passenger transportation and logistics problems.
