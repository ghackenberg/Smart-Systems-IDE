\section{Discussion and outlook}
\label{conclusion}

%Increasingly high penetration of both electric vehicles (EV) and renewable energy sources (RES) will prove a tough challenge for future power and transportation systems. 
In this paper, we presented the TRANSP-0 design framework for rapidly formulating and evaluating integrated transportation and power system design options. We described the framework in terms of static design parameters, the dynamic aspects of system design and the requirements optimal control strategies for designs have to satisfy.
%We demonstrated the feasibility of our approach using a set of incremental scenarios. However, while our approach offers advantages with regard to it's comprehensive planning strategies, the validity of our approach has to be evaluated in the future. 
Future work includes increasing the validity of the model, adapting our model to multi-modal passenger transportation and logistics problems and establishing further constraints and objectives. Furthermore, we currently work on establishing software tool support.
