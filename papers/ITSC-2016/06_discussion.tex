%	\todo{Write discussion. What does the model capture? How well does the model capture this information? What does the model not capture? When do we need the information that is not captured? When don't we need the information that is not captured?}.

%\todo{Multi-modal passenger transport, focus on wider means of transportation}.

Demonstration results obtained with the conducted case study show the feasibility of our approach to adapt to changing scenario configurations and varying scenario parameters.
In previous work \cite{ascher2015integrated} we evaluated our approach with regard to it's validity, novelty, efficiency and applicability. 

The case study employs static profiles based on distribution operator load profiles for home and workplace locations. We demonstrated a set of future scenarios, where electric vehicles are prevalent and are employed heavily within the transportation system. 
%In our example, we didn't show smart electric devices as consumers or producers. However, future impact of is considered to be high. In previous work, we showed heavy integration of electric vehicles as well as renewable energy producers.
