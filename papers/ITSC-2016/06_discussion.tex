\subsection{Design abstraction evaluation}
\label{discussion}

Demonstration results obtained with the conducted case study show the feasibility of our approach to adapt to changing scenario configurations and varying scenario parameters. In previous work \cite{ascher2015integrated} we evaluated our approach with regard to it's validity, novelty, efficiency and applicability. 

The case study employs static profiles based on distribution operator load profiles for home and workplace locations. We demonstrated a set of future scenarios, where electric vehicles are prevalent and are employed heavily within the transportation system.
