	%High penetration of electric vehicles (EV) and renewable energy sources (RES) will require fundamental changes to prevalent transportation and power systems. Intermittent and decentralized loads within the power system caused by RES and EV and the propagation of new transportation paradigms such as transportation electrification and mobility-on-demand will impose critical, closely interrelated changes on these systems.
	%Intermittent and decentralized loads caused by renewable energy sources (RES) and electric vehicles (EV) as well as 
	Increased decentralized energy production as well as the propagation of new transportation paradigms such as transportation electrification and mobility-on-demand will require interrelated key changes to current transportation and power systems.
	To achieve longterm sustainability and diminish negative environmental impacts, close integration between transportation and power systems is necessary and integrated planning, operation and control strategies for these systems have to be established. In this paper, we present TRANSP-0, a system design framework for rapid and iterative formulation and evaluation of design options within integrated transportation and power systems. Firstly, we present the TRANSP-0 design space in terms of the static parameters for integrated subsystem design. Secondly, we present dynamic subsystem design by optimal control problem formulation. Thirdly, we discuss the requirements to control strategies in terms of objectives and constraints of the described optimal control problems. Finally, we conclude with an outlook on the future scope of the proposed system design framework.
