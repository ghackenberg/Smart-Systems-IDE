% The testflow support page is at:
% http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/testflow/



% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Add the compsoc option for Computer Society conferences.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
 \usepackage{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction and Motivation}
Increasing awareness of the environmental impacts of driving has spawned many recent approaches addressing energy-efficient vehicle behavior in the context of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Taking consistent steps towards CO2 reduction and independence from fossil fuels, in recent time, hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) and electric vehicles (EV) have seen increased attention in research. In this context, addressing both (1) energy-efficient vehicle coordination and (2) energy-efficient driving behavior of individual vehicles remains a challenge. For future transportation systems it is crucial to understand the resulting interactions between these concepts.

\section{Related Work}
\subsection{Approaches}
When examining energy-efficient vehicle coordination, two directions of approaches can be distinguished: For one, Urban Traffic Control (UTC) approaches describe the behavior of and the interactions between multiple traffic participants. Facilitating traffic supervision and control, they impose objectives of congestion avoidance and collision avoidance on a global level on the traffic infrastructure. Secondly, focusing on Electric Vehicles, approaches balancing charging demand across different charging stations within the traffic infrastructure are another direction. In terms of their objectives, specific approaches help reducing the potential for queuing at charging stations [1, 2] and/or help to avoid overloading in the electricity infrastructure at charging stations [3].
When looking at energy-efficient driving of individual traffic participants, Eco-Driving/Eco-Routing approaches target energy-efficient driving behavior. In terms of their objectives, Eco-Driving approaches target energy-efficient route selection, while Eco-Routing approaches target energy-efficient intermediate driving behavior.
\subsection{Limits of Related Work}
Approaches for balancing charging demand mainly focus on the interactions between EVs and charging stations within a given traffic infrastructure independent of electricity infrastructure interactions and it’s reactiveness to changing objectives. Demand alleviation at charging stations remains the main objective – an underlying electricity infrastructure with a given set of objectives is not considered in detail. However, rapidly changing objectives are considered through exploring alternative options in terms of charging stations to drive to, based on current suitability. Approaches for balancing charging demand also mainly neglect energy-efficient routing/intermediate driving behavior.
On the other hand side, while current eco-routing/-driving approaches consider energy-efficient driving behavior on a given route, they don’t consider interactions with and objectives of charging stations and the electrical infrastructure. Furthermore, Eco-Routing/-Driving approaches do not employ global planning of the individual traffic participant’s routes and interactions, therefore coordination between multiple vehicles remains an issue, which is only partially alleviated by incorporating real-time traffic information. Because of this, especially Eco-Routing approaches are susceptible to congestions and do not address rapidly changing objectives.
Consequently, all approaches have in common that they aim to address the objectives of energy-efficient system behavior. However, the presented approaches are limited in their scope and objectives and don’t consider interfacing infrastructures and factors at play.


\section{Contribution}
To address this situation, we propose an approach which is capable to address the objectives and the utilization of different infrastructures of traffic participants, charging stations and the electricity grid. The main contributions of this paper are:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Extension of an existing lightweight approach to traffic flow modeling
  with electric infrastructure components.
  \item Description of a lightweight approach to modeling future
transportation scenarios and exploring their dynamics.
  \item Demonstration of the approach including a basic traffic network
with electric vehicles and power grid with charging stations.
\end{enumerate}
Our objective in this paper is to extend initial work described in [4] regarding
early multi-objective traffic flow estimation and demonstrate the variability of the approach for traffic flows depending on different infrastructures and their imposed objectives.

\section{Method}
Our approach is based on emergent property estimation techniques [5] and their adaption to the ITS domain [4]. The approach facilitates the formulation of traffic flow as an optimal control problem consisting of state variables, control variables, constraints and objectives. For behavior estimation the approach employs a generic solver.
We extend our work with power grid and transportation scenario modeling as shown in Figure 1. The models include objective, situation and infrastructure parameters both for the power grid and the traffic network.

\begin{figure}[h]

	\includegraphics[width=0.925\columnwidth]{gfx/approach.png}
	\caption{Overview of transportation scenario modeling including objective, situation and infrastructure parameters for the power grid and the traffic network.}
	\label{fig:approach}
\end{figure}

In the following, the parameters for describing the objective, situation and
infrastructure configurations are explained in detail.

\subsection{Scenarios}

\subsection{Objectives}
In essence, objectives represent operational costs of the traffic network and the power grid. To ease modeling, we distinguish two main categories:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{Global objectives} applying to infrastructures, e.g. objectives
  for the traffic network, such as minimum travel times, or the power grid, such as maximum load balance.
  \item \textit{Local objectives} applying to single components such as routing
  criteria for traffic participants or charging objectives for charging stations.
\end{enumerate}

Note that Figure 1 only concentrates on the global objectives, which typically aggregate the local objectives by means of respective weights.

\subsection{Situations}
The situation mainly includes the individual traffic participants and loads on
the power grid (i.e. production and consumption profiles). In our scenario, traffic participants travel from given origins and to specific destinations on the traffic infrastructure. As traffic participants start out with different levels of state of charge and depending on distance from the destination, charging stations can be utilized by the traffic participants: In order to reach their respective destinations, traffic participants can recharge at charging stations. While travelling, based on their local objectives, costs are incurred for the traffic participants. Local costs, i.e. the costs of individual traffic participants are aggregated at system level.

\subsection{Infrastructures}
Within our system model the employed infrastructure can be distinguished into two main parts: The traffic infrastructure and the electricity infrastructure.
The traffic infrastructure is modelled as a directed graph, whereby nodes represent reference points in the environment such as intersections, while edges in the graph represent road segments between these reference points. Nodes are defined by absolute position based on real-world coordinates, i.e. latitude, longitude, and elevation. Edges, i.e. road segments are defined through source and target node. Furthermore, they are also defined through an assigned number of lanes, a possessed road type, such as residential streets or highways, and a capacity which regulates in- and outbound traffic flow.
The electricity infrastructure is defined by components connected to each other via an electricity grid. It contains the charging stations, which facilitate the charging process of traffic participants. Bridging the gap between traffic infrastructure and electricity infrastructure, charging stations can be assigned to given road segments within the traffic infrastructure.
