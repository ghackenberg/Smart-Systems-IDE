\begin{abstract}
Undesired impacts on the power system caused by electric vehicles (EVs) remain a major challenge that needs to be addressed to guarantee their safe widespread adaption. In this context, efficiently balancing power demand power grids represents a fundamental issue of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) applications of EV. In this paper, we investigate an approach for holistic modeling of transportation systems and electric networks, covering electric devices within the power system and individual cars on a traffic network which make up the transportation system. The approach allows for rapid variation and evaluation of scenarios of both transportation systems and electric networks by varying their configuration, composition and underlying objectives. We apply our approach to different incremental small-scale V2G example scenarios. Obtained simulation results show the feasibility of the approach in terms of employed modeling technique and rapid scenario variation. Based on simulation results, we conclude with an evaluation of our approach with respect to it's validity, novelty, efficiency and applicability.
