\section{Underlying modeling technique (0.5 pages)}
\label{section:contribution_0}

Our approach is based on emergent property estimation techniques \cite{hackenberg2012towards} and uses a model-based approach for validating requirements in early phases of development proposed in \cite{hackenberg2014rapid}, relying on partial system models to ease modeling effort. An adaption to the ITS domain of this modeling technique was proposed in \cite{ascher2014early}, facilitating the formulation of multi-objective traffic flows as an optimal control problem consisting of state variables, control variables, constraints and objectives. The approach employs a generic solver for system behavior estimation, which utilizes stochastic optimization techniques.

In terms of their structure, model components can be atomic or can be composed by other components. Model components have a set of input and output ports, which represent observations about specific behavior. Directed connections between ports allow the modeling of interactivity between different components.

\section{Holistic parametric approach (3 pages)}
\label{section:contribution_1}

In our approach, model definition is aided by a composite model architecture fitted to transportation scenario modeling seen in Figure~\ref{fig:model}. On it's highest level, the model architecture is represented by the system model, which contains separate models for the traffic and the power system. The traffic model represents the traffic system, in which individual cars within the traffic infrastructure are contained. Similarly, the power model represents the power system, which is comprised of different energy producing or energy consuming power devices, such as solar panels, energy storages and charging stations. Furthermore, the power system includes the electricity infrastructure such as low-voltage nets and medium-voltage nets.

	\label{fig:model}
\end{figure*}

The holistic parametric approach allows for each component to be initialized using a specific set of parameters. Subsequently we describe the different components of the model architecture in terms of their respective parameters, interface, structure and behavior.

	\item Behavior:	While traveling on the traffic network, cars consume energy based on traveled elevation profile and chosen speed. Route and speed selection is determined non-deterministically. Cars represent mobile energy storages from which energy is consumed while driving. At charging stations, their energy storage can be charged or discharged.
	
	Objectives of the car are represented as cost functions for the car's convenience/state of charge (SOC), shortest traveling time (T) and energy-efficiency (EE). Costs occur for cars while traveling from origin to destination. The cost functions are defined as follows:
	\[
	Cost_{SOC}(t) =  1-(SOC(t)/SOC_{Max}(t))
	\]
	\[
	Cost_{T}(t) =  1
	\]
	\[
	Cost_{EE}(t) =  EC(t)/EC_{Max}(t)
	\]
	The cost functions are aggregated to a single cost function by different weights defined via parameters.
	
	\[
	Cost_{Car}(t)=Cost_{SOC}(t) + Cost_{T}(t) + Cost_{EE}(t)
	\]
	
	Constraints: A constraint tests whether acceptable values for the state of charge lie within constant minimum and maximum levels.

	\forall t \in \mathbb{T} : \mathrm{0} =  SOC_{Min}(t) \leq SOC(t) \leq SOC_{Max}(t)
