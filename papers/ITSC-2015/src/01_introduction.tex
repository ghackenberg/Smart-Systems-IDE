% EV Motivation, Grid Impact of EVs, Balancing Demand 
In recent years, increasing awareness of environmental impacts has sparked increased interest in electric vehicles (EV) as a means to diminish dependence on fossil fuels. EVs can provide a sustainable alternative to conventional fuel vehicles if their specific demands can be sufficiently addressed by the electricity network and the transportation system.
To support the promise of a viable alternative, impacts on the power grid from EVs remain a major factor that needs to be addressed for truly smart grids, as sustainability of such a concept is strongly related with efficiently balancing energy. 
However, the efficient balancing of energy for EVs within the power grid remains a challenge - a challenge which increases in difficulty with the inevitable widespread adaption of EVs.

% Approaches for Charging Scheduling
% Importance of V2G + Economic impacts
%In recent time, approaches dealing with the optimal charging scheduling for electric vehicles have seen widespread attention in research.
Additional complexity stems from the broadness of possible interactions of EVs with the power grid. Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) interactions are diverse in their nature and intended objectives. 
The charging place of electric vehicles can vary, depending on the drivers preference and the convenience based on vicinity to the drivers intended route. Ideally, the locality of power demand is addressed in charging and discharging decisions based on the impact on the power network as the economic impacts of vehicle carried batteries have been studied in the past to have significant economic impact ~\cite{peterson2010economics,erdinc2014economic}. In practice, however, it has been shown that the majority of EV Users (80\%) are favorable of charging their vehicles at home ~\cite{haines2009simulation}. This manifests the strong difference between the fulfillment of objectives involved in a charging decision for the power network on the one side and electric vehicles on the other side. Therefore, for engineering transportation systems it is important to understand the specific objectives for involved parties and how they influence each other. 

% Importance of V2G + Economic impacts
In the past, research in this context has strongly focused on making optimal charging decisions for EVs with regard to the power network.
Sundstrom et al. \cite{sundstrom2010planning} consider the capacity of the electricity grid in the charging of electric vehicles, thereby avoiding overloading in the grid.
Considering the necessity of charging while driving, Schlote et al. \cite{schlote2012balanced} implement load-balancing strategies for charging demand at charging points into the routing decisions of electric vehicles, resulting in reduced travel times and congestion in the traffic network. Approaches also demonstrated intelligent charging behavior of electric vehicles within respective power network net topologies. Alonso et al. \cite{alonso2014optimal} examine optimal charging scheduling for electric vehicles in smart grids, achieving optimal behavior for charging of EVs within a representative low-voltage net topology. The objective is oriented towards obtaining daily optimal scheduling of EV demand on transformer substations.

However, common among these approaches is that demand alleviation within the power grid represents the main objective. Therefore, differing or additional objectives as well as constraints of the traffic system, it's individual EVs and the power grid can not be explored. Furthermore, different configurations in regard to structure, composition and the objectives of the traffic system and the power grid cannot be explored and analyzed. 

% Scenario definition
Examining the effects of EVs based on scenarios, Soares et al. \cite{soares2012electric} propose an electric vehicle scenario simulator, which enables the definition of electric vehicle scenarios in the context of smart grids and distribution networks. However, it's scope for is limited to the definition of electric vehicles scenarios and relies on external tools for specific analysis and determining impact on the power grid. Furthermore, the height profiles of different routes are not considered in their energetic profile.

In summary, all considered approaches have in common that they aim to address the objectives of energy-efficient system behavior. The issue remains that none of the approaches allow to rapidly explore and evaluate holistic transportation scenarios due to limited scope and intended objectives. Interfacing components of infrastructures are only partially or not considered, leading to insufficient observations about the feasibility of future transportation scenarios.

\subsection{Problem}

After studying related work, we have identified two major problems with existing approaches to future scenario modeling and exploration: First, only very basic models of the electricity network and its components are used such that a number of effects cannot be studied effectively. And second, only limited support is provided for varying the parameters of future scenarios systematically such that important variations might not be considered at all.

\subsection{Contribution}

To overcome the current situation we extend an existing approach to transportation system modeling and scenario exploration such that the electricity network can be represented in greater detail. Then we derive a systematic approach to modeling and varying the parameters of future transportation system and electricity network scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate the approach using a number of examples and discuss its strengths and weaknesses.

\subsection{Outline (Streichkandidat)}

In the following, we describe our approach to integrated transportation system and electricity network modeling in Section~\ref{section:contribution_1} followed by our approach to systematic parameter variation. Thereon we discuss a number of examples and evaluate our approach in Section~\ref{section:evaluation}.
