Increasing awareness of the environmental impacts of driving has spawned many recent approaches addressing energy-efficient vehicle behavior in the context of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Taking consistent steps towards CO2 reduction and independence from fossil fuels, in recent time, hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) and electric vehicles (EV) have seen increased attention in research. 
Furthermore, the impact on the power distribution network remains a challenge for electric vehicles with Grid-to-Vehicle (G2V) as well as Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) interactions to consider.
